title: World Health Organization is Promoting Playing Video Games During Covid19
---

Did you know that the WHO made a campaign that promoted video game playing during Covid19? The WHO back in April of 2020 made a campaign for people to play games that can help promote social distancing. This campaign was a partnership between it and over 50 video game companies encouraging people to play games that are suited towards social distancing. To that end, video game companies gave out free games and to promote following health guidelines. This gave people things to do that can help them spend their time socially distanced. This partnership was known as the Play Apart Together campaign. This campaign shows that an international health organization sees spending time during Covid to play videogames is a great idea.
