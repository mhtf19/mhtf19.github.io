      <h1></a>You Should Play Minecraft</h1>

      <div class="entry">
        You are now interested in playing video games during Covid19. But you do not know which games are good. One of the top games I recommend for new players and veteran players alike is Minecraft (Minecraft is one of the few games not on Steam). For those of you that have not played much video games you may have already heard of this game. For those of you that have played a lot of video games, this game needs no introduction. Minecraft is a game where everything is made out of blocks. You might be wondering if you can play this game. Do not fret, Minecraft has game ports for everything from IOS, Android, Windows, MAC OS, Playstation 4 and Xbox One. In this blog post, I will be talking about the pc versions of the game since most people have pcs. For Minecraftâ€™s computer requirements click <a href="https://www.wepc.com/benchmark/minecraft-system-requirements/" class="read-more">here</a>. For those of you who do not know much about computers and do not know much about pc requirements, do not worry. Minecraft is not that resource intensive of a game. I was able to run Minecraft on a mid-tier windows computer that came out about 8 to 9 years ago. What I consider a mid-tier Windows laptop, is one that costs $500 to $750. However, when I see the specs requirement on that website, I think you can get away with a slightly weaker powered laptop. There are a few ways to play Minecraft. It is both a single player game and multiplayer game. There is a survival mode which you gather resources and try to make the world how you want, while fighting bosses. There is also a creative mode which is basically how it sounds. You do you get to fly around and have access to unlimited resources in your inventory. The goal of creative mode is to create whatever you want. If you need help in the game, there are countless Minecraft YouTube videos. Plus, the Minecraft wiki is a great source of information on Minecraft. It can explains how to make items and how things work in the game.
