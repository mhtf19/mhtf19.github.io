      <h1></a>Mental Health Part 2</h1>

      <div class="entry">
        As talked about in the previous article, during the pandemic the United States is experiencing a mental health crisis. While it maybe obvious to point out this fact is a problem, it is another thing to find the solution or solutions to that problem. Playing video games to relieve stress is a small but important step for the solution to this problem. According to psychologist, Brian Sutton-Smith, the opposite of play is actually depression, a serious mental illness. <a href="https://www.headstuff.org/entertainment/gaming/depression-is-the-disease-video-games-might-be-the-cure/" class="read-more">Click here</a> for an article by headstuff.org that talks about Brian Sutton-Smithâ€™s research and how video games can help fight depression. The article also mentions while there have been studies that show a correlation between people with depression and video games but that does not mean video games are the causation of depression. It instead provides the idea that depressed people are more likely to play video games to provides an escape from their depression. I agree with this stance because video games and playing card games have helped me in the past get through some rough times. I can easily see how it could help others escape from negative emotional states, even if it is for the briefest of moments. The article also mentions a game specifically designed to help people with depression. The article then goes on to talk about a few specific games and how they can actually help you personally. I agree that games can help teach certain mental or social skills depending on the game. Some games are better suited than others at teaching these skills.
