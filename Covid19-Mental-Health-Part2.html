      <h1></a>Mental Health Part 2</h1>

      <div class="entry">
        As talked about in the previous article during the pandemic the United States is in a mental health crisis occur. While it is obvious to point out that fact is a problem, it is another thing to find the solution or solutions to that problem. I believe that playing video games to relieve stress is a albeit small but important step for the solution to this problem plaguing the United States. According to psychologist, Brian Sutton-Smith, is the opposite of play is actually depression, a serious mental illness. <a href="https://www.headstuff.org/entertainment/gaming/depression-is-the-disease-video-games-might-be-the-cure/" class="read-more">Click here</a> for an article by headstuff.org talks about Brian Sutton-Smithâ€™s research and how video games can help fight depression. It also talks about while there have been studies that show correlation between people with depression that does not mean that video games are the causation of depression. It instead provides the idea that depressed people are more likely to play video games to get an escape from their depression. I agree with this stance because video games and playing card games have helped me in the past get through some rough times. I can easily see how it could help others escape from bad emotional states, even if it is for the briefest of moments. It mentions a game specifically designed to help people with depression. The article then goes on how to talk about a few specific games and how they can actually help you personally. I agree that games can help teach certain mental or social skills depending on the game. Some games are better than others at teaching these skills.
