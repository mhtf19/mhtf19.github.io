      <h1></a>You Should Play Bloons TD 6</h1>

      <div class="entry">
      The second game I will suggest was originally from a game series that used flash player in web browsers. For a lot of people, myself included, it is a fan favorite. Bloons TD series is so loved that it is even is going to outlive flash because the newest entry has been released on platforms that are not the flash player. The game is Bloons TD 6. It is a game that is out on Steam, IOS and Android. For the purpose of this review I will be talking specifically about the Steam port (PC). The requirements for it are like the game mentioned in the previous article in the fact that it is not intensive so a lot of computers can run it. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/960090/Bloons_TD_6/" class="read-more">Click here</a> for Bloons TD 6's Steam page. Details are included on the computer requirements. Bloons TD 6 is a single player game that falls under the tower defense genre. In case you do not know what the premise of tower defense games are, it is as follows: you build towers along a path that enemies travel. Your goal is to make towers that attack said enemies, so they do not reach the end of the path. You typically have lives that correspond to how many enemies it will take for you to die if they reach the end. There are these things known as waves where enemies spawn. The waves are increasing in difficulty as you progress throughout the waves. In Bloons TD 6 and any game in the Bloons TD series in general, the enemies are balloon themed and the towers are monkey themed. Monkey themed towers are upgradable. Overall it is a chill game that I highly recommend. On Steam, at the time of writing, it costs $10. However, during the last Steam sale I was able to buy it for 99 cents. Another great thing about Bloons TD 6 is that it still gets updates (at the time of writing). <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/960090" class="read-more">Click here</a> to see their community page on Steam. At the time of writing there the last article was dated on December 2nd. It talks about the most recent update. I highly recommend checking this game out.
