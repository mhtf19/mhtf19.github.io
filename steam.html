        Now that you have most likely been convinced that you should give playing video games a shot, you might be asking the question of where you can play some without having to spend hundreds of dollars on video game consoles. While the IOS and Google Play have great games, most of the ones in my experience most mobile games that are worth playing end up costing money anyway. That is due to the fact that there is a trend with lot of free to play games on mobile in having in my opinion not the best consumer friendly practices. That is why I recommend if you have a somewhat decent pc whether it is a desktop or laptop, I recommend downloading Steam. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" class="read-more">Click here</a> to go to Steamâ€™s website. You might be asking what Steam is. Steam is an online storefront for video game developers to sell you video games. It is free to use but a lot of games cost money. There is everything on it from the big companies to games that were made by one-man indie development studios. Once you go to the site, you can can make an account and download the Steam launcher. You buy games using money and download them directly off the internet. Warning for Mac users, making video games for Macs is a lot less popular than making them for Windows computers, so you should make sure that the game you are going to buy has Mac OS listed in the system requirements list. If not, it most likely will not run-on Macs. In future articles I will recommend some games that I have played that are not too intensive to run, so in the case that you do not have a really powerful pc, you might still have a chance at being able to run the games.
