        Now that you might be considering that you should give playing video games a shot, you might be asking the question of where you can play games. More importantly without having to spend hundreds of dollars on video game consoles. While mobile may have some great games, most of the ones that are worth playing based on my experience are games that are not free. This is due to the fact that there is a trend with many mobile free to play games not having the best consumer friendly practices. That is why I recommend if you have a somewhat decent pc, whether it is a desktop or laptop, I strongly suggest downloading Steam. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" class="read-more">Click here</a> to go to Steamâ€™s website. You might be asking what Steam is. Steam is an online storefront for video game developers to sell you video games. It is free to use but a lot of the games cost money. There is everything on it from games from the big companies to games that were made by one-man indie development studios. Once at the site, you can can make an account and download the Steam launcher. You buy games using money and download them directly off the internet. Please note video game creation for Macs is a lot less popular than for Windows computers. Check the game requirements for Mac OS. If not listed then it is most likely not able to be run on Macs. In future articles I will recommend some games that I have played that are not too intensive to run. That way if you do not have a really powerful pc, you might still have a chance at being able to run the games.
